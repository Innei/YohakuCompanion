# Yohaku Companion Internal API Guide

This document describes the internal contracts used to capture, sanitize, deliver, and audit Presence in Yohaku Companion. These types are application-internal; Yohaku Companion does not expose a binary plugin ABI.

The Xcode project, target, scheme, module, and source directory use `YohakuCompanion`. Several legacy compatibility protocols retain their existing identifiers, but those identifiers are not a product or persistence identity. Release and Debug builds use Yohaku Companion bundle identifiers, and bundle-derived Application Support and credential namespaces do not inspect or migrate the separately installed ProcessReporter application.

## Reporter extensions

`ReporterExtension` represents a Presence destination. S3-compatible storage does not conform to this protocol because it is asset infrastructure.

```swift
@MainActor
protocol ReporterExtension {
    var name: String { get }
    var isEnabled: Bool { get }

    func register(to reporter: Reporter)
    func unregister(from reporter: Reporter)
    func clearReportedState()
    func waitForPendingCleanup(
        until deadline: ContinuousClock.Instant
    ) async
    func createReporterOptions() -> ReporterOptions
}
```

| Member | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| `register` | Install the destination’s generation-scoped send handler |
| `unregister` | Remove the handler and clear retained remote Presence when applicable |
| `clearReportedState` | Cancel or supersede pending publication and clear retained state |
| `waitForPendingCleanup` | Participate in bounded termination cleanup |
| `createReporterOptions` | Declare asset requirements and return the delivery callback |

Default implementations register and unregister by name, perform no remote cleanup, and return immediately from the cleanup wait.

## Reporter options and receipts

```swift
struct ReporterOptions {
    let priority: Int
    let assetCapability: PresenceAssetCapability
    let onSend: @MainActor @Sendable (
        _ data: ReportModel,
        _ assetResolution: PresenceAssetResolution
    ) async -> ReporterDeliveryResult
}

struct ReporterDeliveryReceipt: Sendable {
    let outputSummary: SyncOutputSummary
}

typealias ReporterDeliveryResult = Result<
    ReporterDeliveryReceipt,
    ReporterError
>
```

`data` is already sanitized. A destination must not recover raw source values through another subsystem. A successful receipt contains a safe summary derived from the final provider render. It must not contain credentials, endpoints, authorization headers, public asset URLs, button URLs, or raw responses.

Failed and skipped deliveries do not persist an output summary.

## Asset capability

```swift
enum PresenceAssetCapability {
    case unsupported
    case optionalPublicURL
    case requiredPublicURL
}
```

| Capability | Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| `unsupported` | Destination starts without waiting for icon hosting |
| `optionalPublicURL` | Resolve once; failure degrades the asset but does not block text Presence |
| `requiredPublicURL` | Delivery may be skipped or fail when no public URL can be supplied |

The Reporter resolves one shared asset result for the current delivery generation. Each destination receives `.notRequested` when it declares no asset support.

## Asset hosting

```swift
protocol AssetHostingService: Sendable {
    func resolveApplicationIcon(
        for report: ReportModel,
        capability: PresenceAssetCapability
    ) async -> PresenceAssetResolution
}
```

`S3AssetHostingService` is the production implementation. It stores icon URL records through `DataStore`, keeps upload fingerprints in the local icon-cache authority, and records failed application identifiers in a credential-free local retry queue. `retryFailedUploads()` retries queued applications; `rebuildCachedIcons()` reloads installed application icons for current cache records and uploads them again. It is not registered in the destination mapping and never creates a delivery result.

`PresenceAssetResolution` distinguishes not requested, not configured, cached, uploaded, and failed outcomes. Only the in-memory delivery path may consume the public URL; persisted Sync Events retain a normalized asset status without the URL.

## Delivery errors

```swift
enum ReporterError: Error, Sendable {
    case networkError(String)
    case cancelled(message: String)
    case unknown(message: String, successIntegrations: [String])
    case ratelimitExceeded(message: String)
    case ignored
    case databaseError(String)
}
```

Provider-specific error text may be used for immediate diagnostics, but History persists only the normalized `persistenceCode` and safe `persistenceMessage` projections.

`ignored` represents a destination-specific no-op and is stored as skipped, not succeeded.

## Sanitized report model

`SanitizedPresenceSnapshot` is the canonical, immutable input for the first-party Yohaku connection. `CompanionPresenceDTOMapper` is the only boundary that converts media seconds to integer milliseconds, validates protocol limits, and creates Companion Protocol v2 requests. It does not accept `ReportModel`, raw source objects, credentials, or provider dictionaries.

`YohakuPresenceClient` serializes ordered writes, reserves a durable device sequence before transmission, and retries an ambiguous transport failure with the exact same sequence, request ID, and body. Device Tokens are supplied only to `CompanionHTTPClient`, which places them in the Authorization header. Every authenticated Presence mutation also sends `X-Yohaku-Companion-Version` from `CFBundleShortVersionString` so the server can enforce its advertised minimum client version. The initial standalone app keeps version `1.7.3` for this Core contract rather than resetting the product version.

`CompanionConnectionStore.installPairingClaim(_:)` stores validated non-secret metadata and the Device Token through one protected credential transaction. The transaction uses a credential service derived from the active Yohaku Companion bundle identifier; it never queries or copies a ProcessReporter service. Pairing always leaves Live Desk disabled. `setLiveDeskEnabled(_:)` is the explicit post-preview consent boundary, and `loadEnabledConnection()` does not resolve protected credentials while the flag is false. Because no prior device token is migrated, a standalone Yohaku Companion installation must be paired again.

`CompanionPairingClient.claimAndInstall(pairingCode:deviceName:connectionStore:)` preflights protected storage and `GET /companion/capabilities` before consuming the one-time code. Minimum client version, Presence schema, and `liveDesk` availability must negotiate successfully before it posts the code without an Authorization header. It then validates the returned device scope and sequence and immediately installs the plaintext Token without returning it to UI code.

`CompanionLiveDeskCoordinator` starts only after local opt-in and successful capability negotiation. It publishes a complete privacy-sanitized application and media snapshot on semantic source changes and the negotiated heartbeat interval. Media capture is gated by the negotiated `mediaTimeline` capability, uses a bounded fresh lookup, and preserves `null` for unavailable positions. When Core additionally advertises `mediaArtwork`, the reviewed cover is normalized to a bounded PNG, uploaded through the existing S3/R2 hosting configuration by overwriting one per-device `current.png` object, and then represented by an HTTPS URL whose sole `v` query value is the normalized content SHA-256. The URL is never published before a successful upload; an upload failure degrades to text-only Presence. PID, executable path, bundle identifier, credentials, and original artwork bytes never cross the protocol boundary. The coordinator coalesces concurrent refresh requests and uses ordered clear operations for sleep, screen lock, and shutdown. One `CompanionPresenceAuthorityRegistry` entry retains the same serialized writer and durable sequencer across sleep/wake renegotiation for a given server and device, so an immediate wake snapshot cannot overtake or reuse sequence state from an in-flight clear.

A mutation error with `COMPANION_SCHEMA_UNSUPPORTED` or `COMPANION_FEATURE_UNAVAILABLE`, or an HTTP 426 whose error envelope cannot be decoded, invalidates the current writer. The coordinator cancels its heartbeat, discards that authority, and fetches capabilities again before sending another snapshot.

Every nullable v2 key is encoded explicitly as JSON `null`. This is implemented with custom Codable logic; synthesized Optional encoding is not a valid substitute because it omits absent values.

`ReportModel` remains the compatibility bridge between sanitized source capture and Slack／Discord／legacy MixSpace rendering. It is not a Companion network DTO and must never be reflected or automatically serialized into a first-party request.

Relevant values include:

```swift
@Model
final class ReportModel {
    var id: UUID
    var processName: String?
    var windowTitle: String?
    var artist: String?
    var mediaName: String?
    var mediaProcessName: String?
    var mediaDuration: Double?
    var mediaElapsedTime: Double?
    var timeStamp: Date
    var integrationsData: Data?

    @Transient var processInfoRaw: FocusedWindowInfo?
    @Transient var mediaInfoRaw: MediaInfo?
}
```

The properties named `processInfoRaw` and `mediaInfoRaw` are transient capture structures. They must not be serialized into History or exported. By the time a legacy Bridge destination receives the model, these structures have already been filtered and rewritten to match the sanitized scalar snapshot.

## Privacy policy

`PresencePrivacyEvaluator` combines:

1. source switches from General;
2. global `PresencePrivacyDefaults`;
3. application-specific `ApplicationPresenceRule` values;
4. fail-closed legacy filter projections.

Legacy name and identifier mappings execute after privacy visibility decisions. Explicit application aliases then override mapped display names. Hide always has final priority.

Consumers that need a preview should use the same ordering and sanitized source values; they must not implement a raw-snapshot preview.

## Sync Event persistence

The existing report compatibility field stores a versioned Codable envelope:

```swift
struct StoredSyncEventPayload: Codable, Sendable {
    let trigger: SyncEventTrigger
    let assetResult: SyncAssetResult
    let deliveryResults: [SyncDeliveryResult]
}
```

Each `SyncDeliveryResult` contains:

- stable destination ID and display name;
- succeeded, failed, or skipped status;
- start and finish timestamps;
- a successful safe output summary, when available;
- normalized error code and message for failures.

The decoder returns one of three compatibility states:

| State | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| Modern | Versioned structured payload decoded successfully |
| Legacy | Historical integration-name array; no fabricated failure detail |
| Unreadable | Scalar sanitized snapshot remains available; payload metadata is unknown |

`DataStore.fetchSyncEvents` returns value projections only. A privacy-stale event is quarantined before physical deletion and excluded from queries until deletion succeeds.

## Source providers

`ApplicationMonitor` supplies focused application identity and optional window information. It reads the active window title only while the **Window Titles** source is enabled. Accessibility authorization does not by itself enable title collection, and permission is requested only by explicit user action. Focused application identity remains available when Window Titles is disabled or Accessibility access is absent.

`MediaInfoManager` owns the selected media provider and playback-change lifecycle. The Reporter stops media monitoring when the Media source is disabled, during sleep, and during disposal.

`MediaInfo.duration` and `MediaInfo.elapsedTime` are nullable seconds. `nil` means that the active provider did not supply a reliable value; a real `0` means a known zero and must not be replaced by enrichment data. Construction normalizes non-finite or negative timing values to `nil` and clamps position only when duration is known. Network DTOs convert these values to integer milliseconds at their own boundary.

Source callbacks are generation-scoped. Network recovery requests a fresh capture rather than replaying a retained report.

## Settings and credentials

Destination configuration values are held by relays in `PreferencesDataModel`. Secret values are hydrated from Yohaku Companion’s bundle-scoped `CredentialStore` before Reporter creation. No API imports preferences or credentials from ProcessReporter.

All integration saves and maintenance operations use `SettingsMutationCoordinator`. Credential changes are persisted before the corresponding runtime relay is updated.

Credential editors use an explicit intent:

```swift
enum DestinationCredentialIntent {
    case unchanged
    case replace
    case remove
}
```

An unchanged credential is never copied into the editor. Export dictionaries omit all credential fields.

## Adding a destination

An implementation is complete only when it provides:

1. a stable `PresenceDestinationID`;
2. a `ReporterExtension` with normalized errors and cleanup semantics;
3. a final-payload-derived safe delivery receipt;
4. an explicit asset capability;
5. native draft, test, save, and credential interactions in Settings;
6. menu-bar and History presentation;
7. verification for cancellation, partial failure, offline recovery, pause, sleep, and termination.

If the component only uploads or resolves application icons, implement `AssetHostingService` instead.
